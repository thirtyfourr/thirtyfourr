## Main Project: BlitzAC

### As of recently, I have privated all my old repos due to me releasing information about BlitzAC

Hey there! I'm thirtyfour, a Minecraft plugin and client developer who works with Java ⚙️. My main focus is developing an anti-cheat called BlitzAC ⚡, which provides top-notch protection against cheaters and hackers 🛡️.

Aside from BlitzAC, I also create various plugins and clients that improve the Minecraft experience for players 🎮. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions from the Minecraft community, and I strive to incorporate these ideas into my work whenever possible 💬.

If you're interested in contributing to one of my projects or just want to chat about Minecraft, feel free to reach out ⌨️. Thanks for stopping by!
